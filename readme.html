            The Network Lists API allows you to manage a common set of lists for use in various Akamai security products such as Kona Site Defender, Web App Protector, and Bot Manager. Network lists are shared sets of IP addresses, CIDR blocks, or broad geographic areas. Along with managing your own lists, you can also access read-only lists that Akamai dynamically updates for you.

        <p>
            The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Akamai WAF server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
